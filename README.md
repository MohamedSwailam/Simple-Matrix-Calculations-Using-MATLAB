# Simple-Matrix-Calculations-Using-MATLAB

In this simple example it is assumed that u and v are row-vectors given by:


u = (1, 3, âˆ’2), v = (0.2, 0.5, 0.3)


The following calculations will be done using MATLAB codes:

a) 3 * u

b) u + v

c) u * v'

d) u'* v

Hint: The operator ' denotes the transpose.

P.S.: These codes could be used in GNU OCTAVE as well.
